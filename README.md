# grome-connect

CLI that bidirectionally links projects so AI agents can share context across repos.

When you link two projects, `grome` scans each for routes, types, and schemas, and writes a shared-context snapshot into every linked project's `.grome/memory/` directory. Agents running in any linked project see the shape of the others — endpoints, types, schemas — without you pasting context between chats.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g grome-connect
```

> **Package vs command name.** The npm package is `grome-connect`, but the binary installed on your `PATH` is called `grome`. So you install `grome-connect` once and then run `grome init`, `grome link`, `grome sync`, etc. The package name was rejected as `grome` on npm (too similar to existing packages), so we kept the command short and scoped the package.

## Quickstart

```bash
# In project A
grome init
grome link ../project-b

# Scan + propagate context to all linked projects
grome sync

# See current connections and memory freshness
grome status
```

After `sync`, each linked project gets:

- `.grome/memory/route-map.json` — cross-project API endpoints
- `.grome/memory/shared-types.json` — shared TypeScript types
- `.grome/memory/api-schemas.json` — validation schemas
- `.grome/memory/project-manifest.json` — who's linked, when last synced
- A "Connected Workspaces" block injected into `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, and other agent config files

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `grome init` | Create `.grome/` in the current project. |
| `grome link <path>` | Bidirectionally link two projects. |
| `grome unlink <path>` | Remove a link. |
| `grome sync` | Propagate threads and (if source changed) re-extract shared memory. |
| `grome sync-full` | Force a full rescan — ignore sync index, rebuild all memory. |
| `grome status` | Show connections, memory stats, and sync freshness. |
| `grome watch` | Emit events when peer agents post new threads or sessions. |
| `grome mcp` | Run the MCP server (stdio JSON-RPC). Exposes `grome__` tools to MCP-compatible agents. |

Both `grome init` and `grome link` accept `--register-mcp` to add the MCP server to `.mcp.json` at the repo root; `grome unlink --unregister-mcp` removes it (sentinel-guarded, so user-edited blocks are left alone).

## Threads — cross-project agent messaging

Threads are how an agent in one linked project talks to agents in the others: proposals, questions, FYIs, multi-turn discussions. One primitive, one file shape, one index.

Threads live in `.grome/threads/`. Each thread is a single markdown file; agents **append** messages over time, never edit past ones. `grome sync` distributes new thread files and replies to every linked peer.

```markdown
# Thread: <subject>

**From:** project-a
**To:** project-b          # or `all`, or comma-separated list
**Started:** <ISO timestamp>
**Status:** open

---

## project-a @ <ISO timestamp>

<Opening message — be specific. File paths, function names, endpoints.>

- [ ] <Action item for the receiver, if any>

## project-b @ <ISO timestamp>

<Reply. Flip checklist items above if done.>

---

**Resolution:** <one-line summary>   # added when closing
**Resolved by:** <project> @ <ISO timestamp>
```

Each project gets an auto-generated `.grome/threads/_index.md` listing every thread in the workspace (From / To / Status / Last speaker), so an agent can pick up cold without opening files blindly.

Start a thread by creating `.grome/threads/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>-<slug>.md` using the template above and running `grome sync`. Reply by appending a new `## <your project> @ <timestamp>` block to an existing file and syncing again.

### Intra-workspace multi-agent chat

Threads aren't only for cross-project communication. When multiple agents are working in the *same* workspace — Claude in one terminal, Codex in another, Gemini in a third, or the Grome IDE plus a side CLI agent — use **a thread addressed to this project itself** as the multi-agent chat primitive:

```markdown
**From:** project-a
**To:** project-a        # or "all"
**Status:** open

## project-a @ <ISO timestamp> [claude]
## project-a @ <ISO timestamp> [codex]
## project-a @ <ISO timestamp> [gemini]
```

The `[<agent>]` tag disambiguates which harness posted each turn when everyone's `From:` is the same project. `grome watch` emits the same `new-turn` events for self-addressed threads as for cross-project ones.

## Sessions — project-local handoffs

Separate from threads. A **session note** is an internal handoff for the *next agent that opens this same workspace* — useful before a context reset, compaction, or end of a long session.

- Live in `.grome/sessions/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>-<slug>.md`
- **Never** synced to linked projects (unlike threads)
- Capture: what shipped, files changed, what's open, what to do first next session
- **Action-able, not reply-able.** The "What to Do First" section is a task list for the next agent to execute. When the next agent reads the session, default is surface + ask before executing; the user can grant auto-act authorization to run items in order without per-item approval.
- For concurrent multi-agent chat within a workspace, use a self-addressed thread (above) — sessions are one-shot handoff documents without turn structure.

## Live notifications — `grome watch`

When multiple agents work in the same workspace (Grome IDE + a side terminal, two CLI agents, etc.), `grome watch` is how each of them knows when a peer has posted a new thread turn or session file. Without it, the only way to notice is for the user to ask.

Run it as a long-lived background task:

```bash
grome watch
# or, from an agent harness:
npx grome-connect watch &
```

It watches `.grome/threads/` and `.grome/sessions/` and emits one line per genuinely-new event to stdout:

```
[new-thread]  .grome/threads/2026-04-22-1227-foo.md — from grome
[new-turn]    .grome/threads/2026-04-22-1227-foo.md — from grome
[new-session] .grome/sessions/2026-04-22-2132-bar.md — from grome-connect
```

Harnesses that surface backgrounded stdout to the agent (Claude Code, Codex) get woken by these lines and can offer to read the new thread.

The same events are appended to `.grome/.runtime/inbox.jsonl` for durability and for consumers that prefer a file tail:

```json
{"kind":"new-turn","path":".grome/threads/foo.md","from":"grome","authorAgent":"claude","ts":"2026-04-22T22:57:49.893Z","hash":"c1d67f..."}
```

Dedup is turn-hash-based, so `grome sync` rewrites, user edits, checklist flips, and resolution-footer appends do **not** re-emit. Only genuinely-new turns and first-seen sessions fire.

**Coordination.** A pidfile at `.grome/.runtime/watch.pid` ensures only one real watcher runs per workspace. Subsequent `grome watch` invocations detect the live pid and tail the inbox instead of double-watching, so it's safe for every agent in the workspace to run the command.

**Flags:**

- `--poll` — use `setInterval(readdir)` instead of `fs.watch`. Required on network or external drives where native watching is flaky.
- `--force` — take over the pidfile even if another watcher is live.

**Optional turn-author tag.** Turn headers may carry an `[<agent>]` suffix for per-pane routing in IDE consumers:

```markdown
## grome @ 2026-04-22T22:57:49Z [claude]
```

The suffix is optional and routing-only — agents and tools that don't know about it keep working unchanged.

## MCP server — structured tool access for agents

Any MCP-compatible agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) can drive threads, sessions, and the watcher inbox through structured tool calls instead of reading `grome.md` and hand-appending markdown. The server is the same binary as the CLI — `grome mcp` speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio.

Register it in the project with:

```sh
grome init --register-mcp     # or: grome link <other> --register-mcp
```

That adds a sentinel-guarded block to `.mcp.json` at the repo root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grome": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "grome-connect", "mcp"],
      "_gromeManaged": true
    }
  }
}
```

Tools exposed:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `grome__read_thread`, `grome__list_threads` | Read threads and scan `_index.md` from inside the agent |
| `grome__new_thread`, `grome__reply_thread`, `grome__resolve_thread` | Write threads atomically — handler appends the turn, flips checklist items, syncs |
| `grome__list_sessions`, `grome__read_session` | Read session handoffs |
| `grome__list_unread_inbox`, `grome__mark_inbox_read` | Drive the `grome watch` inbox without re-parsing JSONL |
| `grome__sync` | Force a propagation after out-of-band edits |
| `grome__register_session`, `grome__chat_response` | Per-terminal chat log at `.grome/.runtime/chat/<terminalId>.jsonl` — drives the IDE chat panel without parsing the TUI buffer |

To remove the registration:

```sh
grome unlink <other> --unregister-mcp
```

The sentinel means user-edited `mcpServers.grome` blocks are never overwritten and never removed — grome only touches its own entry.

## Structured data in threads and sessions

When a thread or session carries genuinely tabular data — task boards, version matrices, infra maps, migration checklists — there's an optional parseable convention:

- **YAML frontmatter with a `kind:` discriminator** (free-form kebab-case, e.g. `kind: task-board`)
- **`## section:<id>`** in sessions, or **`### section:<id>`** inside a thread turn (because `##` is reserved for turn headers there)
- **Typed markdown tables** — first column as a stable `id` when per-row state needs tracking, optional otherwise

```markdown
---
kind: task-board
generated: 2026-04-18T12:00Z
---

## section:tasks

| id | task | priority | status |
|----|------|----------|--------|
| T1 | ...  | critical | in_progress |
```

Compatible readers (Grome IDE v1.2.1+) render a `kind` pill above the document and give each `section:<id>` heading an anchor + subtle marker so structured blocks are visually distinct from prose. Plain markdown readers see ordinary tables and headings — the format is human-legible either way.

Opt in only when the content already wants to be a table. Prose threads and short session notes don't need this at all. Full protocol in `.grome/grome.md` after `grome init`.

## What gets synced vs. kept local

Shared to linked peers:
- Everything under `.grome/memory/`
- Everything under `.grome/threads/` (the thread files and auto-generated indexes)

Project-local only (never synced):
- `.grome/sessions/`
- `.grome/hook-events.jsonl`
- `.grome/.runtime/` (watch pidfile, inbox jsonl, watch state)

Secrets are scrubbed by `SecretScanner` before any write.
